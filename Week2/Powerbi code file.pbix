additional DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) formulas and Power BI codes to enhance your Sustainable Supply Chain Performance Dashboard:


1. DAX Measures for Inventory Analysis

1.1 Total Inventory Cost

Calculates the total cost of available stock.

TotalInventoryCost = SUM(Inventory[Stock Levels] * Inventory[Unit Cost])

1.2 Stock Turnover Ratio

Measures how often inventory is sold and replaced.

StockTurnoverRatio = 
    DIVIDE(
        SUM(Inventory[Number of Products Sold]), 
        SUM(Inventory[Stock Levels]), 
        0
    )

1.3 Stock Availability Rate

Percentage of stock available out of total order quantity.

StockAvailabilityRate = 
    DIVIDE(
        SUM(Inventory[Stock Levels]), 
        SUM(Inventory[Order Quantities]), 
        0
    ) * 100

2. DAX Measures for Manufacturing Analysis

2.1 Average Production Time

Finds the average time taken to manufacture products.

AvgProductionTime = AVERAGE(Manufacturing[Manufacturing Lead Time])

2.2 Total Defective Products

Summarizes the total number of defective products based on defect rate.

TotalDefectiveProducts = 
    SUMX(Manufacturing, Manufacturing[Production Volumes] * Manufacturing[Defect Rates] / 100)

2.3 Production Efficiency Score

Measures production efficiency as a percentage.

ProductionEfficiency = 
    DIVIDE(
        SUM(Manufacturing[Production Volumes] - TotalDefectiveProducts), 
        SUM(Manufacturing[Production Volumes]), 
        0
    ) * 100

3. DAX Measures for Supplier Performance Analysis

3.1 Average Supplier Lead Time

Calculates the average time taken by suppliers to deliver goods.

AvgSupplierLeadTime = AVERAGE(Supplier[Lead Time])

3.2 Supplier Reliability Score

Measures supplier reliability based on lead time performance.

SupplierReliability = 
    DIVIDE(
        SUMX(Supplier, IF(Supplier[Lead Time] <= 7, 1, 0)), 
        COUNT(Supplier[Supplier Name]), 
        0
    ) * 100

4. DAX Measures for Supply Chain Performance

4.1 Total Revenue Generated

Calculates the total revenue from all sold products.

TotalRevenue = SUM(SupplyChain[Revenue Generated])

4.2 On-Time Delivery Rate

Percentage of orders delivered on time.

OnTimeDeliveryRate = 
    DIVIDE(
        SUMX(SupplyChain, IF(SupplyChain[Shipping Times] <= SupplyChain[Lead Times], 1, 0)), 
        COUNT(SupplyChain[SKU]), 
        0
    ) * 100

4.3 Total Shipping Costs

Calculates the total transportation costs.

TotalShippingCost = SUM(SupplyChain[Shipping Costs])

4.4 Profit Margin Calculation

Finds the profit margin percentage.

ProfitMargin = 
    DIVIDE(
        SUM(SupplyChain[Revenue Generated]) - SUM(Manufacturing[Manufacturing Costs]) - SUM(SupplyChain[Shipping Costs]), 
        SUM(SupplyChain[Revenue Generated]), 
        0
    ) * 100

5. Additional Power BI Enhancements

5.1 Conditional Formatting for Low Stock Levels

Use Rule-Based Formatting to highlight products with stock levels below the threshold (e.g., 20 units).

Click on Stock Levels column > Conditional Formatting > Background Color and set:

Red for low stock (<20)

Yellow for medium stock (20â€“50)

Green for healthy stock (>50)



5.2 KPI Visuals for Supply Chain Metrics

Use Card Visuals to display:

Total Revenue

Stock Availability Rate

Production Efficiency

Supplier Reliability

On-Time Delivery Rate



5.3 Drill-Through Feature for Detailed Product Analysis

Create a Drill-Through Page to analyze SKU-specific data.

Set Product SKU as the drill-through field, allowing users to right-click and explore detailed information.
